# semantic_SfM
Adding semantics to off-the-shelf SfM products

1. Check out how agisoft process multispectral images and see if it is possible to use semantics to fake additional channels. 


2. Generating semantics.
   Two scenarios need to be considered, (1) known labels and (2) unknown labels. First, consider their effects on the following semantic SfM. Second, think about how to get them. Third, think about their implication in a broader research community.

3. Semantics back-projection error. Need to test one or a few images.
